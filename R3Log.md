## Round 3 | Daily Log

_Wanna start at D1? [Go ahead](#d1-100daysofcode--apr232018)_

### **D21 #100DaysOfCode // June182018**

**coding**

- **$** branding of a HTML5 canvas Pacman game

  - added code to draw the logo in every direction
  - added level difficulties
  - tried to add some sort of "win functionality", but I'm uninspired as to what that could be (after some digging I found the sections of code it could be implemented)

**other**

- checked out CraftCMS as a CMS for bigger clients who want to maintain their site to a certain degree (it's a technology my clients work with, & I like to be prepared 😊)

**thoughts**
What a rocky third round. 😇 After Kitten's surgery, she needed a lot of attention & care. At least now I know, what it means to live like a cat (eating & sleeping & cuddling all day. 🐾)  
Today I took an hour and a half to look at CraftCMS & to watch how to set up a simple blog with it.  
Plus I somewhat finished the branded Pacman game as an easter egg for a client's website.  
Now, I will check out some techs, that I'll need for my new assignment tomorrow & then go to bed, because I wanna be in the office early tomorrow.

_June152018 – June172018_

Another gap. 😅 This time, I focused on the recovery of my little Ginger Kitten. After all, I decided to let her get neutered.  
So three days full of cuddling, sleeping, grooming & caring. 🐾

---

### **D20 #100DaysOfCode // June142018**

**coding**

- **$** Vue.js form widget ( pair programming with the chef)

  - added animations to the main parts
  - refactored CSS
  - added responsiveness

**thoughts**
All the people in the office (shared space of three companies) barbecued together. After that my boss & I fixed some things on the component & added fancy stuff. 🙂 After that I picked up my Ginger kitten from the vet after her surgery.

_1.5h_

### **D19 #100DaysOfCode // June132018**

**coding**

- **$** Vue.js form widget

  - tweaked the Sass code (readability, structure)
  - added axios http request
  - added validation with [vee-validate](https://github.com/baianat/vee-validate)
  - worked on bits & pieces throughout the component

**thoughts**
Today was within those honey days a rather good day. I managed to add a few things. And to clean up my Sass code... but oh my.. the code still looks like 💩. And the budget is almost exhausted. 🙈

_3.5h_

### **D18 #100DaysOfCode // June122018**

**coding**

- **$** Vue.js form widget

  - coded two of the three screen designs (mark up & styling)
  - prepared one

**thoughts**
Moving through honey.. 🍯 I guess, as long as I'm moving forward, all is well. But it sucks, that everything I do at the moment is more puzzling together than understanding & using.  
Today even centering without CSS grid was a challenge.. 😔 I'm back to the feeling, that all the code I'm currently writing is just a big pile of 💩.

_4h_

### **D17 #100DaysOfCode // June112018**

**other/coding**

- **$** Vue.js form widget

  - familiarized myself with the given resources (vee-validate, et al)
  - set up project
  - coded first element

**resources**

- Advanced CSS & Sass

  - converted existing CSS code in SCSS
  - implemented CSS architecture (abstracts, base, components, etc.)

**thoughts**
After not feeling well in the morning, I started with the Advanced CSS course today. Sass is really fun, a bit overkill for a smaller project, but definitely worth learning.  
In the evening, I started with the coding part of the Vue component after checking out all the resources that were given to me for this project. I set up the project & finished the first element of the widget. ✌🙂

_June102018_

Somehow, my energy levels are really low at the moment. This week, I'm gonna take some time to work on my time management & see where time monsters are hiding. 😋

---

### **D15-16 #100DaysOfCode // June082018 - June092018**

**resources**

- Advanced CSS & Sass
  - set up my local system to work with Sass / SCSS
  - learned about using variables, nesting, mixins, extends & functions

**thoughts**
Learning all things basic about SCSS & so far, I really like it. It definitely helps clean up CSS. 😊

_2h_

### **D14 #100DaysOfCode // June072018**

**other**

- **$** new project **Vue.js form widget**

  - finished the screen designs of the component in Figma

**resources**

- Advanced CSS & Sass

  - learned about Sass & its basics

**coding**

- **$** coded a function which takes the current date & returns a response depending on the office hours

**thoughts**
Afternoon in the office. Got a new project as the deadline is a bit too close for the first project. First challenge today: estimate the needed time to complete the task. 😳 Well, I estimated almost within the offered range for the client. Lets see, if I can step up my newbie game. 😅 My mentor believes in me, so I guess I should too.  
On a sidenote, after learning by myself for several months & rare occasions of meeting friends/shopping for groceries, biking the almost 9km to the office is a nice change, but also super exhausting now in the beginning. Plus here in Northern Germany while biking you usually have headwind, no matter the current direction. 😅

_3h_

### **D13 #100DaysOfCode // June062018**

**other**

- **$** new project **Vue.js form widget**
  - did some research/inspiration hunt
  - designed the component in Figma
  - checked out [vee-validate](https://baianat.github.io/vee-validate/) for form validation
- Vue.js range component
  - pair-programmed with my mentor to fix some touch device issues

### **D12 #100DaysOfCode // June052018**

**coding**

- **$** finished the Vue.js component
  - switched the third party component
  - styled the `input[type='range']`-element
  - added conditional styles with JavaScript 😇

**thoughts**
After some tough days, I got to go to the office today. The design was finalized, so I got to work on the styling of the input element, which was admittedly not that easy, especially because the component has to be supported by all major browsers. No grid, no flex, no fancy stuff – it's a rollercoaster between "super fun challenge" & "f#\*k u CSS!".. 😅
But with the world wide web & the help of my clients/colleagues we managed to get the component done. And I'm proud – it's accessible, touch considered & supported by the majority of browsers.  
I'm really glad, I get the chance to learn so much in such a fun environment.

_June022018 – June042018_

Needed to take a break. Every day my to do list was full of tasks, but every day I just slept in, binge-watched old shows & just cuddled with the fur babies. I guess, sometimes those days are inevitable & I figured I would just get through them & rest, than to try to push me & loose my remaining energy. 😬

---

### **D11 #100DaysOfCode // June012018**

**coding/research**

- CSS
  - tinkered a bit with styling of input elements
  - read some CSS-Tricks articles about it

**thoughts**
What a day today. Again – as almost every day this week – today was an 30°C day here in Rostock. After pushing myself to the limits the last days (regarding the heat), I started my day on the balcony just eating a late breakfast & enjoying the morning sun with my fur babies. Just watching them soaking all of the smells & sounds, enjoying the breeze always makes my day. By lunch, the thermometer in my room showed 26°C, so I decided to just clean my place & rearrange everything. Within this week I tried to work in a standing position twice & it totally changed the way I worked. These past months of sitting took a toll on me. So I rearranged my room & build a solution to switch from sitting to standing without much hustle. 🙂
In between cleaning & furniture moving times, did I mentioned the 30°C 😅, I checked out some articles on how to style input elements & tinkered a bit with a codepen project – but nothing fancy.

_1h_

### **D10 #100DaysOfCode // May312018**

**coding**

- **$** worked on the first Vue.js component from yesterday
  - got feedback on the component
  - added more elements (conditional rendering)
  - learned how to extract a component & to set up props
  - learned, wrote & used filters
  - pair-programmed with another dev to adapt the third party range-field -> decision in the end, switch components (to an underdog! 🎉)

**thoughts**
I have to admit, I was a bit nervous to show, what I coded together. 😅 But I think, it was okay for my first Vue component. I learned a lot today by coding in the office, although the afternoon is usually not a good time for me to work focused. There is definitely still a ton to learn & set up. But I LOVE IT! ❤ It's exactly why I started this journey in the beginning. The constant "I don't understand that! I need to learn that!".. It's just paired with an urgent desire of "please just let me check the docs more thoroughly, so I don't need to look every itty bitty up". But that's okay I guess. Just another soft skill I need to learn – "to be comfortable with discomfort". 😊

_4h_

### **D9 #100DaysOfCode // May302018**

**coding**

- finished the birthday card for my favorite recruiter
  - front pure css
  - back mixed content // hand written message
- **$** coded my first Vue.js component
  - set up the project with vue-cli
  - checked out single file components, crash-course-style
  - implemented a **select-field**, an **input-(number-)field**, a third party **range-field** (input- & range-fields are connected)
  - added a button, that calculates something from the different inputs -> output displayed in console so far

**thoughts**
Okay, the card got a little out of control. 😅 At the latest it got obvious when I tried to do all the stars with one single div 6 a lot of box-shadows. 😄 But the birthday human was so happy, it was all worth it. all in all, with a messed up scale, fixing it, all the image editing, etc. it took me about 8h.  
The afternoon was reserved for work, as seen above I will incorporate the work that I do with a little **$**-indicator, when it heavily involves self teaching & I can log it kind of anonymously. 😊 I really have to say, coming from React Vue's html-based template syntax & the directives are pretty funky. But it also is kinda tough to dive head first in a new framework & learn that unprepared by "learning by doing". I hope, I get to go through the courses I have a bit further. I'm much more confident, when I know where to look for answers.  
On the plus side, I'm slowly starting to get the hang of switching between projects.

PS: I tried to work on an improvised standing desk yesterday & this morning... and it is _SO_ good. I get so much more done. Plus a structured dumbbell makes the best foot massage tool. 😊

_8.5h_

### **D8 #100DaysOfCode // May292018**

**coding**

- special scribble for someone's birthday tomorrow
  - front pure css
  - back mixed content

**thoughts**
Of course, the best ideas come like last minute. I went to the office today & had to fight a sunstroke back home. And now I have to work on that digital gift, so it's ready tomorrow. 😊 Definitely worth it, because it's for my favorite recruiter, but still. Last minute means working most of the night. 😋  
But I will provide the link later this week, probably.

_4h_

### **D7 #100DaysOfCode // May282018**

**resources**

- started learning Vue.js with
  - [the official Vue.js guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)
  - [Vue.js 2 – The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide) on udemy
  - [Learn Vue 2: Step by Step](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-vue-2-step-by-step)

**thoughts**
Today, I started to learn Vue.js. Mainly because I want to be prepared as it is the main JS framework my new clients use, but also because it was on my list for a while now. I will check out the mentioned resources a bit more & hope they will give me as much knowledge as a Wes Bos' course. 😋 But to be fair, the course on udemy seems as thorough as Jonas Schmedtmann's courses, which is a really good sign. 😊
Also, today I declared my business as a freelance web developer. 😇 Now, all that is left to do is writing the first bill (once it's time to do so) to make it legit. 😜  
Oh, in an unrelated note, I tried out Affinity Photo for Windows & I'm thrilled. It's a one-time purchase, incl. updates, beautiful interface, provides all the functions Adobe Photoshop does & comes with a 10-day trial. 😊 Good day.

_1.5h_

### **D6 #100DaysOfCode // May272018**

**miscellaneous**

- kept tinkering with the HTML `<canvas>`-tag
  - coded the Apple logo

**thoughts**
More extra work for the client project. But it is super fun, and I'm quickly getting the hang of coding those shape methods. 😊  
In the end, the game didn't render the apple accurately, so I tried `drawImage()`, both with the png & the svg. Unfortunately every solution looks super pixely, but in the end, Pacman is an oldschool game. 😅 I implemented all solutions, so that the client can have a look for himself.

_1.5h_

### **D5 #100DaysOfCode // May262018**

**miscellaneous**

- tinkered a lot with the HTML `<canvas>`-tag
  - coded a hexagon out of triangles
  - coded a little Android symbol

**thoughts**
The refactoring for my clients involves changing the game characters in different logos. Because it's the weekend & I don't know, if it would be sufficient to just implement images in the canvas element or to rather code the symbols, I decided to do it in my freetime. It's a lot like p5.js, which gives me an advantage because I've already spent that much time working on my illustrations.. (And holy moly is the B.A. Baracus of the A-Team detailed..) 😅  
Tomorrow, I'm gonna do the Apple logo, which is a bit more difficult, but putting the image as a background & layering the illustration on top, makes for a rather quick process.  
If I find time, I will also translate it, so that all coordinated origin from the center of the canvas element. 😊  
But for now it's bedtime.

_May252018_

I won't count today, but I still wanted to log, what happened.

Yesterday morning, I met with two web developers in Rostock, one of them I've known loosely for more than 10 years. We talked a bit about what they needed from a frontend developer & about what I've already done. And agreed, that I would work for them on a freelance basis & they would let me know, when they'd have something for me.

Well, today already came the call. And I have a fun little project. It's vanilla JS/HTML canvas & super fun.

So today I worked on that assignment for _4hs_. It is in fact coding. But since I cannot really log, what I do as paid gigs, I will not count it in my official logs.

But! It's a nice achievement to get paid to code. 😊 And that's definitely notable. (I'll wait with the official announcement once I got paid the first time though.😇)

### **D4 #100DaysOfCode // May242018**

**miscellaneous**

- checked one point of my Explore JS list
  - browsed a bit through the [MDN web docs: WebGL API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)
  - watched [The Coding Train's WebGL in p5.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqiKWXUX-o8&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bPhi8sS1hHJ77n3zRO9FR_) playlist

**thoughts**
So.. I had some adulting to do in the morning. And a migraine struck in the afternoon (= loooooong nap 😴). After those kinds of days, there isn't that much happening, so I just read a bit in the MDN docs on a topic that's on my list for a while & watched the better part of the WebGL in p5.js playlist of The Coding Train.

_1h_

### **D3 #100DaysOfCode // May232018**

**miscellaneous**

- read about HTML `<meta>`-tags
- checked out Facebook's Open Graph protocol http://ogp.me/
- checked out the [Twitter dev docs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started.html) for Twitter cards
- updated portfolio a little
- started to implement ogp data in portfolio
- fought again with LinkedIn 😒, it won
- updated some code in chuckyN & the weather app (one fetch error due to http/https & a missing parameter).

**thoughts**
Today was a awkward day, not really bad more on the confusing side of things. Maybe because of tomorrow's meeting. However, I worked on bits & pieces which would otherwise just rot on my to do list forever. 😅 I think, I will make this a weekly habit, just jot down all of those rather tiny tasks & dedicate half a day to get those things done & stay up to date.  
Fixing a mistake in an old app showed me, that I've come a long way. I still like my code & could read it rather good. But I also saw a lot of things, I would not do anymore & I had the urge to refactor the code. But I kept it as it is, because I think it is a nice way to see, how I develop as a developer. And the freeCodeCamp projects are still snapshots of my level of knowledge at that time. 😇

_2.5h_

### **D2 #100DaysOfCode // May222018**

**coding**

- Note Application
  - named app "SMPLnote"
  - added editor & editor tasks
    - update change for note title & text
  - stored state data in `localStorage` of browser
  - added function to delete note
  - pushed project to github & deployed project

» https://Miffili.github.io/smpl_note/

**thoughts**
Everything works, nothing works, everything works again, no that doesn't work. 😅 That sums pretty much up, how it was to work on the React note app. But I got it working except the list issue which is described in the README.md. I have to look at this at some point, checking where the mistake occurs. It's not a fatal error though. Lists just don't get saved in the simpleMDE. But enough for today. 😇

» _5.5h_

### **D1 #100DaysOfCode // May212018**

**coding**

- Note Application
  - start with the course material
  - added sidebar & sidebar tasks
    - add note
    - provide style for current note
    - show current note in editor

**thoughts**
After my break, it feels really good to code again. Although, I have to admit, that I'm having my issues with focusing on one task at hand. I guess it's back to the good old pen&paper method, writing all thoughts down first & then work on the tasks – one by one. 😊

_May112018 – May202018_

Because I was in a rather bad place mentally, I allowed myself to take a thorough break. At some point, I just wrote the same goals/tasks for the day over & over again, without really accomplishing something. It all just felt like a big blur.
After taking more than 2 days off, I restart the 3rd round, but will keep the progress so far in this log.

### **D14 #100DaysOfCode // May102018**

**coding**

- Scribble | LinkedParticles
  - sketched idea on paper
  - started coding

**thoughts**
Admittedly, coding lately was more of a burden than something enjoyable for me. Not the act of coding itself, but choosing on what topics to concentrate. Do I learn a framework? Or another one? Am I learning the right one? How do I learn it in the most effective & maybe the fastest way? Should I already learn another language? How do I compensate the lack of an engineering degree? How do I earn money?
Working with p5 again after such a long time.. and working on something purely for fun, was such a nice change. There are so many things, that are really important in the real world. But for me to keep being motivated & perform on a high level, I need to just do useless stuff from time to time. After all, I have to admit, that the projects I'm most proud of are the ones, I was totally enthusiastic about – the Bubble Machine & the redesigned Simon game. 😊 It's like [Simone Giertz said in her TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0bsKc4tiuY), doing useless things helps overcoming performance anxiety. It's just about fun, not only for oneself, but also for others. 😇 Probably back to schedule tomorrow.

### **D13 #100DaysOfCode // May082018**

**other**

- read about software testing
  - types of software testing (unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests)
  - read through a tutorial of test driven development in JavaScript
  - checked out different tools for testing in JavaScript (jest, mocha, jasmine)

**thoughts**
Unfortunately, I didn't feel that well today & had a hard time focusing. So I decided to check something off my to do list: software testing in JavaScript. 🙂 I think I will incorporate it in future projects, just to get the hang of it & get comfortable using different tools for testing. 😊

### **D11 #100DaysOfCode // May062018**

**resources**

- JavaScript & React for Developers
  - learned about yarn, Grunt & Gulp (definitely need to check that out more)
  - revisited what React is
  - revisited Component Lifecycle Methods
  - revisited state & properties
  - learned about presentational & container components

**coding**

- Get Yo Cook On
  - sketched out modal layout
  - added ingredients & preparation data to recipes.js
  - added modal with recipe details

**thoughts**
Sometimes, I think I wouldn't do enough, especially on days I shift my 'work time' after lunch and take the morning off. But then again, I still have to prepare everything for an eventual move in the future, so I'm not not working.
I'm super happy with the progress today. Especially the Get Yo Cook On is getting along nicely, if I say so myself. 😇 I get the hang of working in steps & working with an external library, in this case reactstrap, for the styling. I know, this part would take me too many hours otherwise.

### **D10 #100DaysOfCode // May052018**

**coding**

- Get Yo Cook On
  - added recipe collection in separate file
  - added state to App
  - hooked RecipeCard up with data via props
  - experimented with different layout additions
  - added type checking to RecipeCard & Landing
  - deployed project

**thoughts**
As it was a fairly warm day today, I enjoyed the weather. 😇 But I managed to update the RecipeCard as I intended to do. Slowly I get in the flow of checking reactstrap for possible components as well as cross reference them with Bootstrap v4 itself. I really like the Card component it makes a lot super simple.
Plus: the React docs are thorough & simultaneously to the point.

**thoughts**
Because I drank a red bull for dinner, I immediately started D9 at midnight. 😅 Solid 2 hours of coding and I'm glad, I did it at night. Nothing there to distract me in any kind. The switch was fairly smooth.
I revisited how to delete a npm package.
Then I slept until noon and my whole day was totally wacked. 😄 Went to bed early to be fresh in the morning.

Well today was immediately off on the wrong foot. I slept in, then talked to my brother for over an hour. Had to collect my thoughts afterwards.. Then scalded three of my right hand's fingers while making lunch and had to cool them for over three hours, hence the lack of coding today. But after midnight, I'm gonna start D9. 😋

- installed chrome extension that displays .md-files in GitHub-style for preview

**thoughts**
Today was a CSS kinda day. 😊 I started with the Advanced CSS & Sass course and all starts to make sense now. But I still am more a fan of JavaScript, who shouts at you in different variants when something isn't working. With CSS, you often times don't even know, **what** is not working let alone **why**. And if not earlier, today it was obvious that I'm becoming a nerd – being happy about installing different packages in ATOM & still being stoked about my windows emoticon picker. 😇 I slowly understand the saying "developers are lazy". 😄

  - sketched out user stories
  - decided to use reactstrap (based on bootstrap v4) instead of react-bootstrap

**thoughts**
I'm back. 😄 After some necessary off days, I started slowly today. At the moment, the most exhausting part of coding is the thought of needing to get a job, because I'm running out of savings. And I'm struggling to decide whether I should already apply for coding jobs, and if so where or if I just try to find a non related job in this area & build up a savings cushion again. Or at least support myself. 🙊

### **D5 #100DaysOfCode // Apr272018**

**resources**

- started CS50x on Week 0
  - introduction to the course
  - introduction to how computers work
    - binary, ASCII, Unicode
    - input -» [Algorithm] -» output
    - computational thinking

**other**

- woke up to a few warnings on all of my create-react-app applications hosted on GitHub

- learned, that it wasn't a critical bug & a false alarm whatsoever
- also learned about package.json as well as package-lock.json files

**thoughts**
Oh, how I wished I had courses like that in my university time! Today I realized, how fun it can be to be self taught, to be free in the choices of courses & not bound to a certain syllabus. I get to choose with whom I learn, and get to put together a plan, that is both fun & educational.  
The warning on GitHub was a nice learning scenario, not only in keeping calm, but also in researching, reaching out to experienced developers & learning to comb through information.

  - merged relaunch branch with master, pushed to GitHub, officially relaunched 🚀

**thoughts**
Today I launched the redesign of my website. It'll remain a work in progress as I got a lot more ideas for it. But for now, I'm pretty happy with it. (Although I always think, I'm designing for giants. The font-sizes are always pretty big. 😇)  
To be honest, I'm kinda sad, because on an instance today, but it'll be all good again tomorrow.

### **D2 #100DaysOfCode // Apr242018**

**coding**

- Website
  - added about section including connect possibilities
- Get Yo' Cook On
  - cleaned up current code
  - added responsiveness
  - added navigation

**thoughts**

Today I made some progress with my relaunch of the website, the basic styling & structure is done. It is, for the moment a MVP to launch & get going. So after the launch, I will continue to work on the website and maybe feed it some more content. 😊  
Working on the Get Yo' Cook On React app, I have to admit, that individual styling with React-Bootstrap is a bit wonky. I may change the styling to match default styles of Bootstrap, e.g. a horizontal navbar at the top of the page rather than a vertical one, as I would like it. We'll see. 🙂

### **D1 #100DaysOfCode // Apr232018**

**coding**

- Website
  - tried to implement smoother transition of mobile menu opening/closing
  - tried to implement fancy hover effect for non mobile menu links
  - feed portfolio

**other**

- installed atom-prettier & familiarized with tool

**thoughts**

After struggling with different advanced CSS effects , I'm definitely putting this CSS course on my list for R3. 😇 But all in all, I really like how the redesign comes along. It's much more sophisticated & job hunt ready. And deciding to code a real nice mvp first, was a good call for my sanity. 😄  
I can't wait to start a much more focused round & to continue with this journey.
