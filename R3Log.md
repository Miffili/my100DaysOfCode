**thoughts**
After struggling with different advanced CSS effects , I'm definitely putting this CSS course on my list for R3. ðŸ˜‡ But all in all, I really like how the redesign comes along. It's much more sophisticated & job hunt ready. And deciding to code a real nice mvp first, was a good call for my sanity. ðŸ˜„  
I can't wait to start a much more focused round & to continue with this journey.
