  * merged relaunch branch with master, pushed to GitHub, officially relaunched ðŸš€

**thoughts**
Today I launched the redesign of my website. It'll remain a work in progress as I got a lot more ideas for it. But for now, I'm pretty happy with it. (Although I always think, I'm designing for giants. The font-sizes are always pretty big. ðŸ˜‡)  
To be honest, I'm kinda sad, because on an instance today, but it'll be all good again tomorrow.

### **D2 #100DaysOfCode // Apr242018**

**coding**

* Website
  * added about section including connect possibilities
* Get Yo' Cook On
  * cleaned up current code
  * added responsiveness
  * added navigation

**thoughts**

Today I made some progress with my relaunch of the website, the basic styling & structure is done. It is, for the moment a MVP to launch & get going. So after the launch, I will continue to work on the website and maybe feed it some more content. ðŸ˜Š  
Working on the Get Yo' Cook On React app, I have to admit, that individual styling with React-Bootstrap is a bit wonky. I may change the styling to match default styles of Bootstrap, e.g. a horizontal navbar at the top of the page rather than a vertical one, as I would like it. We'll see. ðŸ™‚

### **D1 #100DaysOfCode // Apr232018**

**coding**

* Website
  * tried to implement smoother transition of mobile menu opening/closing
  * tried to implement fancy hover effect for non mobile menu links
  * feed portfolio

**other**

* installed atom-prettier & familiarized with tool

**thoughts**

After struggling with different advanced CSS effects , I'm definitely putting this CSS course on my list for R3. ðŸ˜‡ But all in all, I really like how the redesign comes along. It's much more sophisticated & job hunt ready. And deciding to code a real nice mvp first, was a good call for my sanity. ðŸ˜„  
I can't wait to start a much more focused round & to continue with this journey.
