# my100DaysOfCode ‚Ä¢ Round 3

*Start date:* April 23rd 2018

## Bucket list

This round, I definitely want to set some focus points. so that every time I don't quite know, how to move forward I can come back to my bucket list.  
In Round 1 it was all about learning everything, I could possibly find regarding frontend development. I quickly fell in love with JavaScript and all the possibilities it provided to build ‚Äì interactive elements in the frontend, the power behind a lot of Markup & CSS preprocessors, tools, libraries that allowed me to draw/illustrate in the browser. And I loved the challenge of learning it.  
Round 2 was somewhat focused on finishing the freeCodeCamp FrontEnd Certificate & get to know backend. (Which I did. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) In the last weeks I started to learn React.js as my first framework, because I loved the simplicity of implementing it in any existing project & the relatively short but thorough docs (& I've already purchased a React course from Wes Bos üòã).

So for this Round 3 I wanna focus on a few points:  

* working & building with JS front end frameworks/libraries  
* deepen my knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals  
* learn to use CSS efficiently & one preprocessor (Sass, Less)  
* dive into backend  
* web accessibility  
* have fun with creative coding  
* learn more algorithm scripting via codewars et al

*If you think, that's a ton of things I'm heading for, you're probably right, but I'm not one to set reasonable goals.* üòá *After all, having those "over the top goals" allows me to strive for so much & accomplish that much more than "cautiously" phrased ones ever would.*

## Rules

### Commitment

*__For the next 100 days, I will code at least for 1 hour each day__*

#### Additional rules:  
1. Everything code related counts, listening to relevant podcasts, having fun with creative coding, reading books, docs & articles, and actual coding itself.  
2. I will keep [logging](R3Log.md) my progress daily & provide updates on my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/KlaraMiffili).  
3. My health is my top priority. So if for whatever reason I might need a break, I will take it. But I won't take more than two days off in a row or else the challenge is lost. üôÇ
