# my100DaysOfCode â€¢ Round 3

## The end... ðŸ˜…

That didn't work out as planned. This repository had the purpose of documenting my journey to become a developer. To be honest. I reached that milestone in May this year.

Plus, all the different things I do within a day are all over the place. I'm gonna start a new hashtag, which I feel is more appropriate & more of a manageable challenge for me...

Well, I guess it's like they say:

## Rules

### Commitment

_**For the next 100 days, I will code at least for 1 hour each day**_

#### Additional rules:

1.  Everything code related counts, listening to relevant podcasts, having fun with creative coding, reading books, docs & articles, and actual coding itself.
2.  I will keep [logging](R3Log.md) my progress daily & provide updates on my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/KlaraMiffili).
3.  My health is my top priority. So if for whatever reason I might need a break, I will take it. (I try to not take more than three days off in a row, but in the end I will listen to my body/ mind, if it needs to recharge). ðŸ™‚
