# my100DaysOfCode

100 days go by so fast, especially when there is a focus on learning something new every day. My first #100DaysOfCode I started logging in the recommended way by [Alexander Kallaway](https://github.com/Kallaway), but it wasn't for me as it took to long after a productive day/evening. I needed something quicker. So a few weeks in, I started a good old journal, which helped me tremendously.

Starting round2, I want to try it again: This repository serves as my digital Bullet Journal. I'm aiming for a more slender form of the [original](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code), but with all resources that I am using.

## Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode

## Round2 of #100DaysOfcode | Rules

### Commitment

*__For the next 100 days, I will code at least for 1 hour each day__*

*Start date:* January 1st 2018

#### Additional rules:  
1. The main focus is coding, but everything code related counts.  
2. I will [log](https://github.com/Miffili/my100DaysOfCode/blob/master/R2_dailyLog.md) my progress daily & provide updates on my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/KlaraMiffili).  
3. I will provide the resoures I use in an extra file.  
4. My health is my top priority, so if for whatever reason I'm going to need I break, I will take it. But I won't take more than two days off in a row or else the challange is lost. :)
